# BudgetApp
Repo detailing my first full stack app development

## Objective
This project was a full stack web service based on the cloud. This app was designed to allow users to track income and expenses, manage transacations, and visualize financial data through charts. For the frontend I utilized HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap 4, and Chart.js. As for the backend, I used AWS Lambda (Node.js), AWS S3, and mySQL for the database. I implemented a API called Frankfurter Currency Conversion API which allowed for live currency conversion. Lastly, the application supports client side validation and asynchronous data updates for a seamless user experience.
